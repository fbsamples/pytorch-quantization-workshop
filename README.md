# pytorch-quantization-workshop

This repo holds the files for the PyTorch Quantization Workshop conducted by [Suraj Subramanian](https://twitter.com/subramen) at the MLOpsWorld Conference on June 8 2022.

## Notebooks 
#### [Quant_101.ipynb](Quant_101.ipynb) 
Learn the fundamentals of quantization in pure Python code. 

#### [Quant_API.ipynb](Quant_API.ipynb)
Learn about quantization schemes, when some are better than others, and using QConfigs in PyTorch

#### [Quant_Workflow.ipynb](Quant_Workflow.ipynb)
The number of available options can be overwhelming. Choosing the correct quantization technique and scheme is an empirical process; this notebook contains a workflow that aids choosing the most suitable option to quantize your FP32 model.
